/**
* Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to
* obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
*
* Example:
*
* For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
* almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;
*
* There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.
*
* For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
* almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.
*
* You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2].
* Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
